    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Youth Mentorship Hub was born from a simple idea: every young person deserves guidance, support, and someone to believe in them. Whether you're a student unsure of your career path or a professional eager to give back, our platform creates the bridge.</p>

    <p>We focus on connecting youth with mentors from all walks of life — engineers, artists, entrepreneurs, teachers, developers, and more — so learning isn't limited to textbooks. It's real, lived, and shared.</p>

    <p>Our mission is to close the opportunity gap. We do that by facilitating honest conversations, skill-building sessions, and long-term relationships between mentors and mentees. Every voice matters, and every story has the power to inspire change.</p>

    <p>Join us — whether you want to grow or help others grow. This is where purpose meets people.</p>
